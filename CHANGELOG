2004.07.14 - altered httpd.conf setup to
	have wicap-php on port 8080 and
	the dist docs on 80.  Also, changed
	install.sh to reflect this.

	added "mac address checking" to both
	add.pl and allow.pl.
2004.07.21 - added "logrotate" functionality
	and added logging of successful
	auths per PTP definition of an auth.
2005.06.10 - changed allow.pl to block on a fifo named pipe
	(rather than a flatfile), which means that,
	clients no longer have to wait 10 seconds for the
	lease-file to be polled. The only bad thing,
	is that leases are only analyzed when a new client auth's,
	so a client could keep a lease indefinately, if there
	are no other auths. Also, this file is not a persistent
	record, so if the server is restarted, clients must re-auth.
	Overall, I think these problems are okay in light of
	the positive benefits of the change.
2005.07.20 - rewrote allow.pl to be threaded, then realized
	that the dist. OpenBSD perl is not threaded. Gave up
	and rewrote allow.pl in 'C' as allow.c. This version
	is uses fork and IPC instead of threads (thanks to a bug
	in the pthread libs). It also does arp-lookup itself,
	and it probably much faster than the original allow.pl. 
2005.12.23 - working on porting to freebsd. made some changes
	to the code to get it to compile on freebsd (all cosmetic changes),
	and added a makefile for freebsd.
