-= WiCap-PHP Install Instructions =-

Installation should be pretty easy 
if you are working with a fairly straight-forward
install of OpenBSD 3.x (tested on 3.5 and 3.7). 
If you are not, it will probably still work
but may require a tweak here and there.
I will start with requirements, and then
get to the program itself.

	Outline of Steps:

	1. Apache
	2. PHP
	3. Install
	4. Firewall
	5. Daemon
	6. Cron
	7. DHCP and DNS
	8. Testing

Also, notice this Wiki page which outlines many of the
same steps:

Here we go...

1) Apache 

Most likely this is already installed
and has some files at /var/www. You should be able to
: `apachectl start`. If you don't have it, use
pkg_add to add it (*really* easy if you bought the CDs).

To make openbsd start Apache on boot do:

	echo httpd_flags=\"\" >> /etc/rc.conf.local

A sample config is at sources/conf/httpd-*.conf. You should
(after backing up the dist. version) install the one that
fits your situation (probably httpd-minimal.conf) at
/var/www/conf/httpd.conf. Also check it over for site-specific corrections.

You may want to start her up and look at:
http://your.ip/ to see if it works.

2) PHP 

You will need to install this.
Simply pkg_add the php-core (if you don't have the CDs,
you have a few options, the easiest is to do pkg_add over ftp:

	pkg_add -v ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.7/packages/i386/php4-core-4.3.10p1.tgz

You may want to:

	apachectl stop
	apachectl start
	echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/htdocs/phpinfo.php 

and look at http://your.ip/phpinfo.php to see if
php is working.

4) Install Files

./install.sh should do this for you. This script
was only tested a little bit, you may want to look
it over before you blindly execute it. If you are
very cautious (or cynical), you can use it is a
road-map to do the install manually.

Firstly, it will attempt to compile the daemon 'allow'.

Next, it will try to install the files
at /var/www/usr/local/wicap-php and then make a symlink
at /usr/local/wicap-php to this location. This way,
wicap-php is at /usr/local/wicap-php whether you are
in a change-root jail at /var/www (like apache) or
if you are not in a change-root jail. (This will avoid
headaches). 

this is also a good time to goto http://your.ip:8080/
and try out the splash page.

5) Setup the firewall

You need to install the pf.conf at
source/conf/pf.conf in /etc/. This is the *most* crucial
step - it is also the most easily blundered. Make
sure you look it over before you blindly install
it...your settings may be different.

To get openbsd to use these rules now

	pfctl -e
	sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

To get openbsd to use these rules when it boots

	echo pf=YES >> /etc/rc.conf.local

then edit /etc/sysctl.conf and uncomment these lines

	net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
	net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1

5) The Daemon: allow

To start the daemon, there is a little script "allow.rc" that
does it correctly, try this:

/usr/local/wicap-php/bin/allow.rc

Also, you may want to add this to /etc/rc.local, so it will
start on boot.

6) Cron

wicap-php comes with some infrastructure to rotate
it's own logfiles. Maybe you have a way that you
like to rotate logfiles, you are welcome to use that.
The most crucial file is allow.log as it will
slowly grow without bound (if debug output is enabled). 
If you wish to do things my way, add a cron entry like:

00      2       *       *       *       /usr/local/wicap-php/bin/rotate.cron

By default, in OpenBSD 3.5, roots crontab will live at
/var/cron/tabs/root

7) DHCP and DNS

If you want to make using your wireless network an accessible
thing for people who can't read minds, you should have a functional
DNS cache and DHCP, there is plenty of information around
about how to set these things up.

8) Testing and Customization

There really isn't a good way to test the setup without having a wireless
client handy, try do go through the typical functional use-case:

	1. Get an ip-address using a dhcp client
	2. Open a web-browser, no matter which page you load,
           you should be redirected to the splash page
	3. Click "ACCEPT", you should be redirected to a success page
	4. Go to some other webpage

If something goes awry, remember that by default PHP errors are logged
in /var/www/logs/error_log and *are not* reported to the user. If you
are having problems, and you think it is wicap-php's fault, contact me.

You may want to customize the splash page, the files are put at:

/var/www/usr/local/wicap-php/htdocs. The filenames should explain
the purposes. At very minimum you probably should alter config.php.

Good Luck!
