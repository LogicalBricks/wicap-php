So, much like Brian Caswell - the author of wicap,
I found myself wanting a simple captive portal
that functioned in OpenBSD. What I found was:

- NoCatAuth: OpenBSD support "sketchy at best"
- NoCatSplash: OpenBSD support non-existant
- WiCap: No documentation, not modularly coded,
	written in CGI
- Others: No OpenBSD support, cost money, or suck.

In the end I wrote this simple portal in
a way that markedly resembles the original wicap
with a few differences:

1) The web-based application is written in PHP not Perl.
2) There is no database, the web-application communicates
	with the daemon via a FIFO special file
3) Written for OpenBSD 3.5 and onward rather than 3.0 and
	3.1.
4) Actually has some documentation.
5) Will hopefully be maintained.
6) Uses pf tables to update the ruleset rather than
	mucking around with temporary files.
7) Designed to fit agreeably within the OpenBSD default
	chrooted httpd.
8) Does not require dreaded the CGIExec option.
9) Now works on OpenBSD 5.1
